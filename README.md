# Louisbot4
discord message statistics bot

Louis sits in the background and tallies messages, including emoji count on said message, every 50 (configurable) messages. louis can then be invoked by a discord command, to give instant statistic data.

This is the third iteration of LouisBot, and the first to use this passive tally system, older methods which did a bulk scan, from scatch, at every invokation, they also had no server integration, and could only be invoked via the command line, as the program was a one shot. louisbot4 is a great improvement in methodolgy.
